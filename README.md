## Contributing

Code in the current repo abides to the same [guidelines as
MRPT](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

On using the git VCS, do have the following bullet points in mind:


1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
