## Description

Current directory contains a list of models suitable for simulation / demos.
These are to be used by the algorithm implementations of the current repo. These
models (probably) are different than the ones provided by V-REP itself as they
are probably adjusted to be used out of the box with the algorithms of the
mrpt_vrep_bridge repository.

If there are models that are specific to an algorithm add them to a subdirectory
named under that algorithm, otherwise put them next to this README
